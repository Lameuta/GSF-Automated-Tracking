# GSF-Automated-Tracking
The project aims to track an object without the need of registering a region-of-interest, this is something like object detection, but without manual selection of region-of-interest for training data like how YOLO needs for training. This project utilizes light-weighted CNN binary classification models alongside a grid-based approach to automatically detect and track desired object, eliminating the need for manual region-of-interest selection in registered tracking. Unlike state-of-the-art object detection method YOLO (you only look once), this approach does not require to manual selection of region of interest for training data. This method is suitable for tracking object for a long period of time, especially when there are obstructions within the time frame.
